# 🧠 ML Community Summer Bootcamp 2025 – Projects & Practice

Welcome to my repository documenting my hands-on journey through the **ML Community 2-Month Summer Bootcamp**, taking place from **June 15 to August 15, 2025**. This bootcamp provides a structured, practice-oriented approach to mastering Python, data analysis, and machine learning — all with just **1 hour per day**.

This repository serves as:
- A personal project portfolio of my ML learning journey.
- A collection of weekly notebooks, Kaggle solutions, and final projects.
- A record of consistent skill development using industry-standard tools.
